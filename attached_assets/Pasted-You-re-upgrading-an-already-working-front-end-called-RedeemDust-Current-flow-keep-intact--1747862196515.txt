You’re **upgrading** an already-working front-end called **RedeemDust**.
Current flow (keep intact):

1. User pastes a proxy Safe address.
2. Clicks **Fetch Dust** → subgraph query populates a scrollable table.
3. User scrolls to the end, sees the running **Total** and a green **Connect Wallet to Redeem** button.
4. Wallet connect → sign SafeTx → send TX →View Tx.

Your task is to impelement monetization logic and  polish UX/UI without changing that linear flow or the underlying logic.
Extra Impelmentation
change "1" to the fee we charge. remeber we have a sum value before and refernce payment strucutre below
&#x20;   const value = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1", USDCE\_DIGITS); // Replace with your transfer value. Consider BIG NUMBER!

## Required improvements

1. **Sticky summary bar**
   • When the table scrolls, keep Total + Fee + CTA visible (sticky bottom on desktop, sticky top on mobile).
   • Fee = **2.5 %, min 0.05 USDC, max 1 USDC**.
   • Display breakdown: Subtotal – Fee – Net.

2. **Service-fee transparency**
   • Add a small “ⓘ Fee details” hover tooltip next to the fee line.
   • Tooltip text: “We charge 2.5 % (min 0.05 USDC, max 1 USDC) collected inside the same Safe transaction”

3. **Proxy Safe clarification**
   • Rename the address label to **“Proxy (Safe) Address”**.
   • Add an inline help icon that opens the FAQ modal at the “What is a proxy Safe?” section.

4. **FAQ modal (re-usable)**
   Sections (accordion or tabs):
   • What is a proxy Safe? (like tell they what addres to put there - the proxy, what address to connect & sign, if you register polymarket say using metamsk then use exactly same account, other wise you are not the owern. and we dont support magic link registered user now)
   • How is the fee calculated?
   • Security & open-source links.
   Trigger links: footer + help icon.

5. **Empty & error states**
   •  for network errors (maybe they put the wrong chian it should be poly 137)

6. **Design language**
   • Keep existing palette (white background, indigo/emerald accents).
   • Round cards to `rounded-2xl`, shadows `shadow-md`.
   • Typography hierarchy: `text-3xl font-semibold` for h1, `text-sm` for table rows.
   • Use shadcn/ui components where possible.

## Non-goals

• Do **not** add Redux or any server code.
• Do **not** alter the signing / payload logic.\\

## Test checklist

☐ Sticky bar remains visible during scroll on both breakpoints.
☐ Fee line updates when table total changes.
☐implremnt monetization logic 
☐ FAQ modal opens from both trigger points.
☐ Error banner appears on wrong network id.

Ship when all checkboxes pass.
