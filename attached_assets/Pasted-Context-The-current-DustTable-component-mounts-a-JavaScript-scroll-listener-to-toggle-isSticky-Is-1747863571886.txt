Context
The current <DustTable> component mounts a JavaScript scroll-listener to toggle isSticky.
Issue:

The summary bar only appears when the viewport reaches the very bottom of the table, then vanishes as soon as you scroll up a few pixels.

When it is visible, the bar spans almost the full screen while the table content is narrower, so the two elements feel disconnected.

Steps to Reproduce
Load any address with ≥ 10 dust positions (so the page needs to scroll).

Scroll down slowly.

Notice the bar flashes on at the end of the list, then disappears when you scroll up even a little.

Expected
Sticky bar should remain visible for the entire scroll session once the table’s header leaves the viewport.

Width of the sticky bar should match the table container for visual alignment (desktop & mobile).

Root Cause (probable)
handleScroll() only checks table bottom vs. viewport height.
– When the bottom is still visible (tableBottom < viewportHeight) the bar is sticky; otherwise it isn’t.
– As soon as you scroll up (now tableBottom ≥ viewportHeight) the bar resets to “relative”.

Bar width is hard-coded with w-full when sticky, but the table lives inside a max-w-xl wrapper.

Proposed fix
Replace JS listener with pure CSS sticky

tsx
Copy
Edit
{/* wrapper div around table & sticky bar */}
<div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto relative">
  …table…

  {/* NEW – CSS only */}
  <div className="sticky bottom-0 bg-white border-t border-gray-200 py-3 px-4
                  rounded-b-2xl shadow-md">
    …summary content…
  </div>
</div>
No scroll handler; browser keeps it stuck as soon as its top edge hits bottom:0.

Align widths

Put both the table and the bar inside the same max-w-4xl mx-auto container.

Remove the dynamic inline style width logic.

(Optional) mobile tweak

On small screens you may prefer the bar to be sticky top-0 instead of bottom.

Tailwind: className="sticky bottom-0 sm:top-auto sm:bottom-0" already solves this—keep it.

Acceptance criteria
 Bar remains on-screen while any part of the table body is off-screen (scroll both up and down).

 Bar width equals table width on desktop (max-w-4xl) and full-width on mobile.

 No JS scroll handler in DustTable.tsx.

 Lighthouse “avoid long tasks” passes (removing listener helps).

Judgement call on sizing: constraining the bar to the same width as the table looks cleaner and keeps the CTA visually grouped, so we’ll narrow the bar rather than widening the table.
